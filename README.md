## Description 
This web-application built for seaside Cafe provides a easy point of contact for clients before visiting the cafe as well as knowing what is being served by seaside cafe. The users are able to view which all dishes are being offered by the cafe. They are also able to reserve a table at the cafe for the current or/and future dates. It also offers personalised page to the user, where users can log in ***************************************************


## Get Started
you will need to clone repository from https://github.com/RichardMartinAus/Seaside-Cafe.git

The project depandencies can be downloaded via npm package manager using npm install command.

We need to create a database 'cafe_db' in 'MySql' by loging into mySql using command terminal and typing command 'mysql -u root -p' & typing the mysql password when prompted.

Once the database is created, we need to create tables by running the 'npm start' script.

Once the tables are in place, we need to populate the database by seeding the tables with data by running the script seeds\index.js using terminal

we connect to the server via dotenv.

## Using the Application
